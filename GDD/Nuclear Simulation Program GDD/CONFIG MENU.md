It contains several settings to modify the state of the simulation in real time:

# Detector States
These checkboxes enable and disable their associated [[DETECTION AREA]] or [[MOBILE DETECTOR]]. It is currently hard-coded to the existing detectors, but this could be changed in the future.

# Detector Size
These slider modifies the radius of all [[DETECTION AREA]]S and [[MOBILE DETECTOR]]S. It is currently hard-coded to the existing detectors, but this could be changed in the future.

# Nuclear Size
This slider changes the size of the nuclear device (ie: the distance from the [[THREAT]] at which it will be detected by a [[DETECTION AREA]] or [[MOBILE DETECTOR]].)
