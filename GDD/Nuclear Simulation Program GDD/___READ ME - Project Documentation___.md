Hello - My name is Constantine Pallas, and If you're reading this, you're likely either me in the future, someone evaluating my work, someone continuing work on this project, or some combination of these. I'm writing this document to explain how the program works, hopefully to the benefit of any of the people described above.

# Basic Overview

This program was designed to simulate the movement of a crowd about the interior of a sports stadium. The simulation contains the following:

- Interactive Elements
	- The stadium environment
	- Ordinary People (referred to in the project files as [[CIVILIANS]])
	- A person with a nuclear device (referred to as [[THREAT]])
	- A person carrying a nuclear detector ([[MOBILE DETECTOR]])
	- Several static nuclear detectors ([[DETECTION AREA]])
	- Several points of interest that individuals may attempt to visit ([[POI]])

- Interface Elements
	- Text box to display events that happen ([[EVENTS CONSOLE]])
	- Settings menu to adjust state of interactive elements ([[CONFIG MENU]])
